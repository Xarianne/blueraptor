# Bluewhale

A personal image based on the [finpilot](https://github.com/projectbluefin/finpilot) template by Universal Blue. 

- Has Hyprland with Dank Material Shell (home dots managed via Distrobox) as well as GNOME
- Terra repos enabled for codecs and latest mesa 
- Some CachyOS tweaks (ananicy, GUI to set custom schedulers). 

I will happily break this to experiment with things. Might not work for you.
